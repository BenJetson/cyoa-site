                    <p>You are transported into the breakwater hotel. This is where FDR is staying, he is currently reading the New York Times. The title of the New York Times officially states "Theodore Roosevelt's Third Term?" He is there sitting in a chair with his legs crossed and his face with a grin on it. He looks at his inspirational figure with faith because he knows that he is going to be like his cousin one day. Once you enter the breakwater hotel you see the him, and you think whether to get his attention or not. You want to do something great, since you are back in time.  So do you talk to him or not? </p>
