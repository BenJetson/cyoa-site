                    <p>You step out of the time machine, and you begin to look around. Everything around you looks old and out-of-style. Off the ground, you pick up a flyer about FDR and his stay at the Breakwater Hotel. After walking around for a considerabile while, the Breakwater hotel seemingly materializes in front of you. You are sure it was the place, since you saw it on the flyer. You run towards it hurriedly, you can't wait to meet your great uncle!</p>
                    <p>You walk into the main lobby of the hotel, and there he is, reading a copy of the New York Times. The cover article was titled "Theodore Roosevelt's Third Term?," which is highly ironic, you think. You couldn't believe it, but it really was him -- sitting there with a friendly smile on his face.</p>
                    <p>Now, you have to make a decision, do you talk to him or not? You really want to make a difference in history, and you want to meet your great uncle. However, at the same time, you also are concerned that you might modify history in a bad way. You recall reading several books about time travel, and many of them ended badly because the main character modified time and created a paradox. Nonetheless, if any time, now was the time to speak to him if you must. He might move somewhere else, and you'd miss your chance. Do you speak to him or not?</p>
