                    <p>Instead of following Giuseppe, you decide to stay at the club and have a few drinks. After a few hours, you discover that the food you had earlier isn’t sitting so well with you. You think that the chef may have not cooked the food properly. Not long after, you have intense stomach pains and throw up several times. A group of people decides to carry you to the hospital for treatment.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unfortunately, the hospital in the town was not terribly advanced, and used very poor quality, unsanitary techniques. The doctor decides that they must operate to remove all contents of your stomach. The tools that they used were not cleaned properly, and were horribly rusty and old. You begin to feel even more sick, and the doctors aren’t really sure what’s wrong with you.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the coming weeks, you grow weaker and weaker. The tools they used contained a nasty virus and blood from the previous patient. As it is nearing the end, you suddenly vanish from time, without you even noticing. Giuseppe had killed your grandfather, Teddy Roosevelt, and without his existence, you were never born, creating a time paradox. </p>
