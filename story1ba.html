                    <p>You decide not to talk to FDR right away. You think it would be a better idea to take your things to your room, relax for a little bit, and get situated. A couple of hours later you decide to go down to the hotel restaurant for some dinner. While you are eating a woman catches your eye. You go and introduce yourself and spend the rest of the night getting to know her. The woman asks if you are free the next day and you tell her that you are. </p>
					<p>The next day you meet the woman for lunch. You realize you have so much in common with her and you two fall in love instantly. At lunch she explains that she is down here for a play that she is in and invites you to come that night at 7:00. That is the same time of a dinner that you were supposed to go with all of the presidential candidates. You decide to go to the play. </p>
					<p>	That night after the play you go out with her and celebrate a great performance. Yâ€™all are having so much fun that you get lost of time and realize that it is 2 in the morning. The woman comes with you and stays in your hotel room for the night. When you wake up you go have coffee and read the paper. On the front page it says that Teddy Roosevelt, your grandfather who you were supposed to be saving, had been shot and killed by Giuseppi. You then realize that you have been sidetracked this whole time because you have been having fun instead of taking care of business. Before you can do anything else you are vanished from time because you have not completed your mission.  </p>
