                    <p>	As Giuseppe is leaving, you get up and follow him, trying to make it unnoticeable. You follow Giuseppe for a long while, and you think that you’ve done a pretty good job of concealing yourself from him. After about a half hour, Giuseppe turns left into a dark alleyway. You decide to keep following him anyway, “why give up now?” you thought. As you are walking, you see a sign off in the distance, but you can’t quite make out what it says. As you get closer, you realize that the sign says the street is a dead end, but it’s too late to turn back now.</p>
					<p>You lose track of where Giuseppe went. You turn around a few times, and you hear a clicking sound. You look to your left, and there is Giuseppe, hiding behind a garbage can. You slowly walk over, and you discover that Giuseppe has a gun pointed at you. You raise up your hands, and think that you’re dead for sure.</p>
					<p>Suddenly, you hear a loud boom sound from the back wall of a bar next to you. A man comes flying out of the window, and broken shards of glass flew everywhere. Immediately following him was a strange, short little woman who is swinging an axe and carrying a Bible. You then recognize that she’s Carrie Nation! She’s the woman you have heard about all over town who has been trying to ban the use of alcohol. She sees Giuseppe crouched behind the garbage can with a gun, and she begins to chase after him at an incredibly fast pace. She runs him out of town, and you never hear from Giuseppe again. Afterwards, you both sit down for a drink … of water. </p>
