                    <p>Once you decide that you are going to go to talk to FDR many captivating things happen. You ask FDR ‘Where is his cousin’? FDR looks around and says ‘You seem like a reasonable man, my cousin is on board a train’. You say ‘Thanks’, and take off. You get on the train, and you're sitted right next to Roosevelt's killer, and you look at him and think what would leed a man to kill, then you say to the killer ‘How are you feeling?’, and he says ‘Feeling good’. When it becomes midnight, you see the killer sleeping, and you see the the gun, .38 hanging from the pocket. You have to decide whether you will go through with it or not. Then, you get out of the train and take a walk, and decide what to do. Then you take and it, and you switch the bullets with blanks. After that, you get off in the next stop, and history moves on as it’s written. Roosevelt gets shot, and survives the bullet. As you return back to your own time, you see that it’s been more than a month, it's been ten years. You sit around, and you are shocked, but you realize that if you have not saved your grandfather, then you would not be there. Then the book concludes with you being victorious. You, Henry Roosevelt have won. Then you look at a document that say's prevent the assination of Lincoln, then you smile.</p>
