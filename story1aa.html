                    <p>You sit down at the bar next to Giuseppe and introduce yourself. He asks you “What’re you in town for?” You respond “I’m here to see Teddy Roosevelt speak.” Giuseppe opens up his jacket to reveal an old .32 caliber revolver. He says “I’m here to see him speak too.” Giuseppe can obviously see the shock on your face as you say “and what do you plan to do with that?” “Take a guess,” he responds.</p>
					<p>You continue talking through the night and he explains the evils of Teddy Roosevelt.  He tells you how Teddy Roosevelt is destroying the United states and he needs to be stopped. He lays out his plan to assassinate him and ask for your help. You sit there considering it. Mulling over his plan in your head and something clicks. You begin to think how much better the world would be if he your grandfather did not survive the next few days. You decide to help.</p>
					<p>You decide to help him. You are standing  there with the gun in your hand. You see Teddy Roosevelt walk on stage and see Giuseppe raise his gun. You raise yours as well and both open fire. Eleanor roosevelt pulls an old Confederate Griswold out and returns fire. She hits Giuseppe and kills him. She sees a secret service agent hiding and takes his thompson submachine gun and opens fire at you. You are hit in the leg and slowly disappear because of the Grandfather Paradox.  Teddy Roosevelt, Giuseppe, and you are dead. Eleanor takes over and rules with an iron fist.</p>
