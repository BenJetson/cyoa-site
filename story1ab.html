                    <p>Instead of talking to Giuseppe, you decide to order some food. You order a big hamburger plate with extra fries and a giant mug of tea. While you are eating, you hear Giuseppe and another man talking loudly about something. Since you’re curious about what they are talking about, you move move to a table closer to theirs. </p>
                    <p>Your food arrives, and you sit down to a hearty meal. It was the best hamburger you had ever eaten. As you are listening, you realize that Giuseppe was planning to murder president Roosevelt the very next day. The other man thought it was a great idea, but he didn’t want any part of it. Just as you are finishing your food, Giuseppe gets up and starts to leave the club, and the other man sits down at the bar. Do you follow Giuseppe?</p>
