                    <p>You step out of the time machine, and you start to look around. After a few minutes, you realize that you are in Stiltsville, and the year is 1933. You decide to start your journey at the Calvert Club, and to get some dinner while you're there. You walk over, and step inside.</p>
                    
                    <p>You sit down at the bar, and as you look around the room, you see Giuseppe Zangara sitting at a table, sipping on wine. You remember learning about him and his mission to kill Roosevelt before you left. You begin to ponder whether or not you should confront him now. "What if it creates a time paradox?!," you think aloud, not realizing that you were doing so. You decide to sit down at the bar and have a drink or two to calm your edgy nerves. As you're waiting for the bartender, you can feel yourself shaking, and you can't stop thinking about Giuseppe.</p>
                    
                    <p>After a couple of drinks, you start to think about confronting him again. Do you confront him now, or just stay and eat dinner?</p>
